Road Accident Data Analysis

ðŸ“„ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to uncover key trends and insights, enabling a better understanding of accident patterns and their impact. The dataset has been thoroughly cleaned and organized to produce meaningful visualizations and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). The goal is to present the findings in an intuitive and interactive format for easier interpretation.
